The ISO Player Project

Audio CDs offer the highest quality music playback that is widely available to consumers. There are "lossless" FLAC files,
but I want the real thing. Which is where The ISO Player Project comes in. 

In a single, easy-to-use program I want to:

1. Create an ISO image from a CD
2. Using the index information stored on the disk (and therefore the image), create a database of available 
song, artists, albums, genres, and other common ways of sorting music (similar to iTunes).
3. Using this database, be able to create playlists of tracks and be able to play them from the ISO images.
4. Use a built in virtual drive to seamlessly mount images for playing.
